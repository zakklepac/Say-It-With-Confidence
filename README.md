# What Are You Working On?
This program is designed mostly for humor given that inanity of the results will make you cringe or roll your eyes.

We really focused on making this an aesthetically pleasing app that will make a passerby giggle once or twice. A nice light at the end of the tunnel for my Q1 project.

At the end of the day, we are developers seemingly always looking for the next project. On each reload of the page, you will be greeted by a tasteful greyscale image as well as a "tech-related" phrase complete with voice audio from Google.

Technologies used: JavaScript, Google Voice API

Services: Picsum

Upcoming features will include:
-Voice Replay
-Saving your "Fortune"
-Mobile optimization

Please enjoy!
